- [ ] Following the same camelcase naming convention, create drink price variables for drip coffee, latte, and cappuccino.

- [ ] Create customer variables for Sam, Jimmy, and Noah.

- [ ] Create the order status flag (true/false) for each customer.

- [ ] Cindhuri ordered a coffee. Based on her order status, print the correct status message to the console.

- [ ] Noah ordered a cappuccino. Use an if statement to check the status of his order and print the correct status message. If it is ready, also print the message to display the total. Note: Outcomes may be different depending on what you assigned as the status.

- [ ] Sam just ordered 2 lattes, print the message to display their total. Next, use an if statement to print the appropriate order status message. Change the isReady flag value from true to false or vice versa in order to test your control logic (if-statement).

- [ ] Jimmy just realized he was charged for a coffee but had ordered a latte. Print the total message with the new calculated total (what he owes) to make up the difference.

- [ ] Try changing the price values for each drink and isReady flags (booleans), to test if all of your logic works, even when prices and statuses are changed.
